# CLI Installation

As the project should come with the least possible dependencies, the CLI is a standalone executable and it's the only thing you need to install.

| OS | Architecture | Link |
|----|--------------|------|
| MacOS | apple chip (arm64) | [download](https://github.com/PaulWeinsberg/dcmd/raw/main/cli/bin/aarch64-apple-darwin/dcmd) |
| MacOS | intel chip (amd64) | [download](https://github.com/PaulWeinsberg/dcmd/raw/main/cli/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin/dcmd) |
| Linux (or Windows WSL2) | aarch64 (arm64) | [download](https://github.com/PaulWeinsberg/dcmd/raw/main/cli/bin/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/dcmd) |
| Linux (or Windows WSL2) | x86_64 (amd64) | [download](https://github.com/PaulWeinsberg/dcmd/raw/main/cli/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/dcmd) |

If you don't know which architecture you have, you can run the following command in your terminal (in WSL2 for Windows) :

```sh
uname -m
```

To make it accessible from anywhere on your local machine as an executable run the two lines below in your shell or in WSL for Windows :

```sh
chmod +x dcmd
sudo mv dcmd /usr/local/bin/dcmd
```

Or find any other path that exist in your $PATH variable.

**Fix MacOS quarantine issue :**

```sh
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/dcmd
```
