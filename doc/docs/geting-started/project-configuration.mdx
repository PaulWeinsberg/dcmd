# Project configuration


## Docker environment variables

Copy `.docker/.env.example` to `.dockser/.env`, then set the right variables values for your project :

| Name |	Description |	Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| SUBNET_BASE	  | Each project should have its own subnet base | 192.168.[1-254] or 172.17.[1-254]
| PROJECT_ROOT  | Where your project is located	| /Users/me/Projects/my_awesome_project
| PROJECT_NAME	| The name of your project      |	my_awesome_project

## Project name

In the `.docker/docker-compose.yml` file you must set the name of the project on the top (can't be loaded from env variables). my_awesome_project for example:

```yaml
version: '3.9'

name: my_awesome_project

services:
  # services below...
```

## Project structure

Default project structure

```bash
project_root
├── .docker
│   ├── .env
│   ├── commands
│   │   ├── my_custom_command
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── etc
│   │   └── service_name
│   │       └── service_config.conf
│   └── services
│       └── service_name
│           └── Dockerfile
├── dcmd.toml # optional in that case
└── # ...every files related to your project, framework, etc
```

You can change the default project structure by creating a dcmd.toml file at project root and set the right paths.

See [CLI Configuration](/docs/cli/configuration) section.

**Custom project structure**

If you need to change the default project structure you can do it by creating a dcmd.toml file at project root and set the right paths.

All the paths are relative to the project root but you can use absolute paths as well. Note that every variables are required once this file is created.

```toml
[docker]
folder = '.docker'
compose_file = '.docker/docker-compose.yml'
compose_env_file = '.docker/.env'
stop_timeout = 3
```
