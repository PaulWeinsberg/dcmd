# DNS resolution

Docker commands needs to resolve VHOSTS from your local machine, in order to do so you need to setup a custom DNS domain that point to your local DNS server.

### MacOS

**Setup custom DNS resolver**

```sh
sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolver/dev.local
```

### Linux

**Setup custom DNS resolver**

```sh
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
```

Note that if the queries are too long maybe you already have a nameserver configured which it used before and then switch to the right one, in that case you can edit the file /etc/resolv.conf and move the previous line on top of it.

### Windows

**Setup custom DNS resolver**

Run PowerShell as administrator then run the following commands :

```sh
Add-DnsClientNrptRule -Namespace ".dev.local" -NameServers "127.0.0.1"
```
