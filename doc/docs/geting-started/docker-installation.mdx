Docker Desktop is the easiest way to install Docker on Windows, it comes with a WSL2 backend and a GUI to manage your containers.

Note that another way to install Docker on Windows is to use the Docker Toolbox or Hyper-V backend but it is not recommended and Docker Commands does not provide any support to these configuration, the CLI should run in a WSL2 environment.
