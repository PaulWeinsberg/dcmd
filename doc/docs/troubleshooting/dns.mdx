# DNS

## Port 53 already alocated

If you have any issue related to the port 53, check if you have another DNS server running on your machine (dnsmasq, docksal, ddev dns for example), if so stop it and try again.

Example with docksal :

```sh
fin system stop
```

**Example with dnsmaq on MacOS :**

```sh
sudo brew services stop dnsmasq
```

**Example with dnsmaq on Linux :**

```sh
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
# Can be disabled to avoid restarting it on reboot
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq
```

**Example with systemd-resolved on Linux :**


In the file /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, uncomment this line

```sh
[Resolve]
...
DNSStubListener=no
```

Then replace symlink for /etc/resolv.conf

```sh
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

Add the nameserver:

```sh
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
```

Finally restart systemd-resolved

```sh
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```
