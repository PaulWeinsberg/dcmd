# Configuration

## Default project structure

```bash
project_root
├── .docker
│   ├── .env
│   ├── commands
│   │   ├── my_custom_command
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── etc
│   │   └── service_name
│   │       └── service_config.conf
│   └── services
│       └── service_name
│           └── Dockerfile
├── dcmd.toml # optional in that case
└── # ...every files related to your project, framework, etc
```


## Custom project structure

If you need to change the default project structure you can do it by creating a dcmd.toml file at project root and set the right paths.

All the paths are relative to the project root but you can use absolute paths as well. Note that every variables are required once this file is created.

```toml
[docker]
folder = '.docker'
compose_file = '.docker/docker-compose.yml'
compose_env_file = '.docker/.env'
stop_timeout = 3
```
